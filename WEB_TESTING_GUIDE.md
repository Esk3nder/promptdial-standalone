## üí° Tips for Best Results

1. **Start Simple**: Use the pre-built scenarios first
2. **Adjust Weights**: Experiment with quality/cost/latency preferences
3. **Multiple Techniques**: Try different optimization techniques
4. **Save Good Results**: Copy optimized prompts for future use
5. **Monitor Costs**: Keep an eye on API usage in results

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Optimization Failed" Error
- Check Service Status tab - all services should be green
- Ensure you have API keys configured in `.env`
- Verify services started successfully

### Services Show as Offline
- Make sure you ran `./scripts/deploy-local.sh`
- Check terminal for any startup errors
- Try refreshing the page

### No LLM Provider Configured
- Add at least one API key to `.env`:
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
  GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=AIza...
  ```
- Restart services after adding keys
