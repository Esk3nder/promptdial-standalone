# PromptDial 3.0 Microservices Transformation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the gap analysis, implementation plan, and test canonization for transforming PromptDial into a pure microservices architecture matching the PRD specifications.

## Key Findings

### 1. Current State
- ✅ **All core services exist** - The microservices architecture is already implemented
- ✅ **Docker containerization** - All services are containerized
- ✅ **Service communication** - HTTP REST APIs implemented
- ⚠️ **Hybrid architecture** - Both standalone and microservices modes exist

### 2. Critical Gaps
1. **API Schema Mismatch** - Current API uses different field names and structure
2. **Missing Techniques** - IRCoT, DSPy methods, AutoDiCoT not implemented
3. **Evaluator Calibration** - No confidence intervals or drift detection
4. **Security Enhancements** - Missing Llama-Guard integration and sandboxing
5. **Telemetry Schema** - Not warehouse-compatible

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Alignment (Weeks 1-2)
- API schema updates to match PRD
- Test case canonization ✅ (Complete)
- Security enhancements

### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-4)
- Missing technique implementations
- Evaluator calibration system
- Telemetry warehouse schema

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)
- Performance optimization
- Continuous learning loop
- Compliance features

### Phase 4: Production Ready (Weeks 7-8)
- Edge case handling
- Load testing
- Documentation

## Test Canonization ✅

Three consumer-grade test cases have been canonized:

### 1. Smart Credit Card Selector
- **Category**: Financial decision making
- **Features**: Retrieval, self-consistency, structured output, evaluation rubric
- **Fixture**: `tests/fixtures/credit-card-selector.json`

### 2. Constraint-Tuned Tokyo Trip Planner
- **Category**: Travel planning with constraints
- **Features**: Multi-plan generation, budget verification, accessibility
- **Fixture**: `tests/fixtures/tokyo-trip-planner.json`

### 3. Six-Month Spanish B1 Accelerator
- **Category**: Educational curriculum design
- **Features**: CEFR alignment, spaced repetition, adaptive monitoring
- **Fixture**: `tests/fixtures/spanish-b1-accelerator.json`

### Integration Tests
- Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/consumer-prompts.test.ts`
- Tests validate full optimization flow
- Checks for technique usage, constraint satisfaction, and quality metrics

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Begin API schema alignment
   - Implement missing techniques
   - Set up development tracking

2. **Team Assignment**:
   - Assign developers to each phase
   - Set up weekly progress reviews
   - Create detailed task breakdown

3. **Success Metrics**:
   - All FR requirements met
   - Performance targets achieved
   - Security validation passed
   - 80%+ test coverage

## Key Deliverables

1. **Gap Analysis**: `docs/gap-analysis.md`
2. **Implementation Plan**: `docs/implementation-plan.md`
3. **Test Fixtures**: `tests/fixtures/*.json`
4. **Integration Tests**: `tests/consumer-prompts.test.ts`

## Architecture Decision

Recommendation: **Remove standalone mode** to achieve pure microservices architecture
- Simplifies codebase
- Ensures consistent behavior
- Matches PRD requirements exactly
- Reduces maintenance burden

## Risk Mitigation

1. **API Breaking Changes**: Version endpoints (v1/v2)
2. **Performance**: Continuous benchmarking
3. **Security**: Regular audits
4. **Dependencies**: Circuit breakers

## Conclusion

The transformation to pure microservices is achievable within 8 weeks. The existing architecture provides a solid foundation, with most services already implemented. Focus should be on alignment with PRD specifications, completing missing features, and ensuring production readiness.
